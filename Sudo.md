# Sudo 

## What is Sudo?
- `sudo` (Super User DO) allows a permitted user to run commands as a superuser (root) or another user.
- Unlike `su`, which switches users, `sudo` runs commands with elevated privileges without changing users.

## Installing and Checking Sudo

### Check if sudo is installed
rpm -qa | grep sudo  

### Install sudo (if not installed)
yum install sudo  

### List installed files
rpm -ql sudo  

### View sudo configuration files
rpm -qc sudo  

### View sudo documentation
rpm -qd sudo  


## Sudo Configuration File
- The main configuration file is: `/etc/sudoers`
- Always edit using:
  ```bash
  visudo
  

## Managing Sudo Permissions

### View sudoers file without comments
grep -v "^#" /etc/sudoers | sed '/^$/d'


### Default sudo rule:
```bash
root ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

### Format for adding users:

USERNAME HOSTNAME=(USER:GROUP) COMMANDS

- `USERNAME` → User receiving sudo privileges
- `HOSTNAME` → System where the user can execute commands
- `GROUP` → The group under which the user can run commands
- `COMMANDS` → Specific commands allowed

### Example Entries in `/etc/sudoers`

#### Give full sudo access to 'neha'
neha ALL=(ALL) ALL  
```

## Checking Sudo Permissions
```bash
sudo -l   # Check sudo access  
sudo id   # Show user ID with sudo  
sudo -u neha id   # Run command as another user  
sudo -u neha -g IT id   # Run command as a specific user and group  
```

## Granting Sudo Access to a User
1. Open the sudoers file:  
   ```bash
   visudo
   ```
2. Add the following line:  
   ```bash
   neha ALL=(ALL) ALL
   ```
3. Now, neha can use sudo:
   ```bash
   sudo -l
   sudo id
   ```

## Using the Wheel Group
- The `wheel` group is predefined in `sudoers`.
- Any member of this group can run all commands as any user.

### Adding a User to the Wheel Group

#### Add user to wheel group
gpasswd -a neha wheel  

#### Verify group membership
cat /etc/group | grep wheel  
```

After adding `neha` to the `wheel` group:
```bash
sudo -l  
# Output: User neha may run the following commands on localhost: (ALL) ALL  

sudo id  
# Output: uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
